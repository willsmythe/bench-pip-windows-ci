# This takes ~8-12 seconds to download the .zip (?? I guess python.org
# is not super quick), and then 2 seconds to unpack and away we go.
# But, the official zip distribution is missing some key bits (pip,
# headers), so it's a dead-end.
#
# Still, seems very promising that something like this would be fast
# on Azure if the zip file were created properly, and could be
# downloaded from somewhere closer to the VM. (Maybe even the C:
# drive.)
